## 0.1 Introduction

This lab is part of the APAC Cloud Test Drive and is the 2nd lab about creating microservices

## 0.2 Objectives

- Import Code from external Git Repository
- Build and Deploy project using Developer Cloud Service and Oracle Application Container Cloud Services

## 0.3 Required Artifacts

- The following lab requires an Oracle Public Cloud account that will either be applied by yourself or supplied by your instructor.

- You will need to install an IDE environment and GIT client in your local computer. The instructions assume you are using the VM provided as part of this workshop. The VM is also used in the [Oracle DevOps Cloud Native Microservice Workshop](https://github.com/oracle-weblogic/cloud-native-XWeeks/blob/master/cloud-native-devops/README.md). You can download the VM [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B0MXC4qaECO6RHBWMEttdW9fOVk). Additional information about the VM can be found [here](../Java%20Apps/virtualbox.md).

# 1. Create Offer REST API Microservice

## 1.1 Create Initial Git Repository - Offer REST API

- Login to Developer Cloud Service if you haven't done so. If you are in the Cloud Dashboard, you can use Developer Cloud Service Hamburger Menu to navigate to DevCS.

- In the New Repository wizard enter the following information and click **Create**.

	**Name:** `OfferMicroservice`

	**Description:** `Microservice to provide REST API of Offer Details`

	**Initial content:** `Import existing repository`

	**Enter the URL:** `https://github.com/APACTestDrive/OfferMicroservice.git`

![](images/003.newrepo.png)

- You have now created a new Git repository stored within the Developer Cloud Service that is based on an existing repository

![](images/004.repo.png)

## 1.2 Create Default Build and Deployment Process - Offer REST API

Now that we have the source code in our Developer Cloud Service managed Git Repository, we need to create a build process that will be triggered whenever a commit is made to the master branch. We will setup a **shell script** build process in this section.

### 1.2.1 Create Default Build Process - Offer REST API

- Click **Build** on the navigation panel to access the build page and click **[+ New Job]**

![](images/005.navibuild.png)

![](images/033.addbinding.png)


## 1.5 Verify the Working Service

- In you application panel, you should see the base URL of your application. Something like https://offer-{your-identity-domain}.apaas.{your-data-center}.oraclecloud.com

![](images/037.url.png)

- Copy and paste the URL into the address bar of a new tab to bring up the application.

  Be reminded that you will need the REST endpoint and the **offer id** in order to generate a QR code.

  The final URL should looks like this

https://offer-{your-identity-domain}.apaas.{your-data-center}.oraclecloud.com/ptmgt/v1/offers/10001

![](images/038.browser.png)

- You should be able to get offer details from the Microservice.
